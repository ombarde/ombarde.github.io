Om Barde
AI Developer | Real-Time Video Analytics & GPU-Accelerated AI
Systems | NVIDIA Certified
New Delhi, Delhi, India
Summary
I’m Om Barde, an AI Developer with hands-on experience in realtime video analytics, GPU-accelerated AI systems, and large-scale
AI infrastructure benchmarking. I specialize in building productiongrade AI solutions that operate reliably under real-world constraints
such as low latency, high throughput, and multi-camera scalability.
I hold a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and have earned multiple
NVIDIA certifications across AI, GPU computing, and infrastructure
domains. My recent work focuses on designing GStreamer-based
video pipelines, training and optimizing computer vision models, and
deploying CUDA-enabled inference systems for traffic monitoring
and logistics automation.
I have practical experience across the full AI lifecycle — from dataset
preparation and model training to GPU-accelerated inference,
system integration, and performance tuning. I’ve also worked
on MLPerf Training and Inference benchmarking, validating AI
workloads on NVIDIA H200 and L4 GPUs under strict acceptance
criteria.
Previously, I contributed to NLP systems (BERT-based sentiment
analysis), research-driven computer vision projects, and scalable AI
deployments, collaborating with organizations such as Unifins IT Hub
and the University of Texas at Austin.
Core Focus Areas
-Real-time Video Analytics & Computer Vision
-GStreamer Pipelines & Multi-Stream Video Processing
-GPU-Accelerated AI (CUDA, H200, L4, A5000)
-Model Training, Fine-Tuning & Optimization
-MLPerf Benchmarking & AI Infrastructure Validation
